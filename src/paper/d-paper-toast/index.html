<!--
`paper-toast` provides lightweight feedback about an operation in a small popup 
at the base of the screen on mobile and at the lower left on desktop. Toasts are 
above all other elements on screen, including the FAB.

Toasts automatically disappear after a timeout or after user interaction 
elsewhere on the screen, whichever comes first. Toasts can be swiped off 
screen.  There can be only one on the screen at a time.

Example:

    <paper-toast text="Your draft has been discarded." onclick="discardDraft(el)"></paper-toast>
    
    <script>
      function discardDraft(el) {
        el.show();
      }
    </script>
    
An action button can be presented in the toast.

Example (using Polymer's data-binding features):

    <paper-toast id="toast2" text="Connection timed out. Showing limited messages.">
      <div style="color: blue;" on-tap="{{retry}}">Retry</div>
    </paper-toast>
    
Positioning toast:

A standard toast appears near the lower left of the screen.  You can change the
position by overriding bottom and left positions.

    paper-toast {
      bottom: 40px;
      left: 10px;
    }
  
To make it fit at the bottom of the screen:

    paper-toast {
      bottom: 0;
      left: 0;
      width: 100%;
    }
  
When the screen size is smaller than the `responsiveWidth` (default to 480px),
the toast will automatically fits at the bottom of the screen.
